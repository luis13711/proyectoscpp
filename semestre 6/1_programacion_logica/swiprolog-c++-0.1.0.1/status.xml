    <para>SwiProlog-C++ isn't finished yet. It is in a proceded state, and
      as far as it goes, is tested and mostly documented. It also should be
      quite mature and usable, since a lot of thought and reconsideration
      has gone into it. However, some things remain to be done. And it
      hasn't been in much usage yet.
