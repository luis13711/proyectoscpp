                   SwiProlog C++ - Prolog/C++ interface
                                -DATE-


This is version -VERSION- of the SwiProlog-C++ library for interfacing
between SWI-Prolog and C++. See manual.html for details.


Installation
------------

There is no automatic installation script, but installing is easy. 

1. unpack the package somewhere

2. The actual interface consists of the files prolog.cpp, prolog.hpp and
manual.html. Place these files anywhere you like, on your machine. I
suggest to compile prolog.cpp along with the other sources of your project.

The other source files form a program for testing SwiProlog-C++. They can
also be used as examples.

The following places would be compliant to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.

/usr/local/include/prolog.hpp
/usr/local/share/swiprolog-c++/prolog.cpp
/usr/local/share/doc/swiprolog-c++/manual.{xml,html}

3. The HTML version of the manual is included. If you want to rebuild the
manual from the XML sources, you need a working Docbook-XML installation.
Change the paths in db.xsl and in Makefile. If you are using a different
XSLT processor than xsltproc, you also need to adapt the call in the
manual.html make target.
