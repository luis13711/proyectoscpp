<p>SwiProlog-C++ is a wrapper around the SWI-Prolog Foreign
      Language Interface. It allows you to write parts of a program in
      Prolog, and other parts in C++. You can either embed the SWI-Prolog
      engine in a C++ application, using it as a logic component, or use
      C++ to define foreign predicates (or both).
    </p>
<p>SwiProlog-C++ aims at a smooth integration of the SWI-Prolog
      constructs in the C++ environment. It makes use of advanced C++
      features, such as templates, namespaces and STL integration. It tries
      to shield the user from hard to understand memory management and
      other issues of the SWI-Prolog implementation.
      Using SwiProlog-C++ should be much easier than using the Foreign Language Interface.

<p>SwiProlog-C++ isn't finished yet. It is in a proceded state, and
      as far as it goes, is tested and mostly documented. It also should be
      quite mature and usable, since a lot of thought and reconsideration
      has gone into it. However, some things remain to be done. And it
      hasn't been in much usage yet.

<p>This section describes how to use SwiProlog-C++ and provides
        examples. The full details are covered in <a href="#reference" title="Chapter 3. Reference">Chapter 3. Reference</a>.

<a name="tgtcg"></a>The Global Term Components Graph</h2></div></div>
<p>Terms are the central data type. They reside in memory
      managed by the Prolog engine, and are accessed via handles from the
      C++ side. The handles are encapsulated by the class <tt>Term</tt>,
      which is the most important type for interfacing to Prolog.
    </p>
<p>All the terms form a global graph of term components. Terms can
      be atomic (atoms, numbers...), or compound. Compound terms consist of
      a functor ID and pointers to subterms. They can share common
      subterms. Interfacing to the Prolog engine is all about dealing with the
      terms in this global graph.
    </p>
<p>On the Prolog side, we have value semantics. This means,
      variables denote values, not storage places like in C++. Values can't
      be changed. Free variables denote values that are &#x201C;not yet
      known&#x201D;. Terms can contain free variables, which makes them
      &#x201C;incomplete values&#x201D;, a notion alien to imperative
      programming. (Things become more complicated if you use non-logical
      prediates.)
    </p>
<p>Seen from the C++ side, terms <i>do</i> change, by
      unification. Free variables can be bound. This replaces them by the
      terms they get bound to. They also change by backtracking, when
      bindings are undone. Subterms can be shared by several superterms.
      When a subterm changes, all the superterms change as well. You can't
      tell from a term which other terms share parts of it. Unification and
      de-unification (binding and unbinding) are the only way terms can
      change.
    </p>
<p>A <tt>Term</tt> object is a handle for a term in the global term
      component graph. It behaves (mostly) like a pointer. Such pointers
      are the only way to access terms. In particular, <tt>Term</tt> objects don't
      behave like term <i>values</i>. They are pointers.
    </p>

<a name="id2704890"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="id2704890"></a>Initialisation</h2></div></div>
<p>In version 0.1.0 it isn't yet possible to have the main()
    function on the Prolog side. It must be a C++ function. </p>
<p>At the beginning, the Prolog engine must be initialised. This is
      done by <tt>prolog_init()</tt>. It also must be shut
      down at the end. SwiProlog-C++ makes sure this happens. It is also
      possible to explicitly shut down the Prolog engine and restart it.
    </p>
<p>A typical <tt>main()</tt> function looks like this.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  try {
    prolog_init(argc, argv);

    // ...

  } catch (PlError&amp; err) {
    cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;error: &quot; &lt;&lt; err.message() &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 1;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Anything involving the Prolog engine must be done after it is
      started. [In fact, not exactly anything, but let's pretend so]. This
      means that any Prolog related data (terms, atoms, functors, ...)
      can't be static. The following will not work. Instead, one would have
      to do the initialisation of any global or static data after the
      engine is ready.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">Term t(&quot;foo(1,2,3)&quot;);

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  // ...
}
</pre>
<p>There is a mechanism in SwiProlog-C++ for handling such defered
      initialisation; and reinitialisation in the case of a restarted
      engine. All the affected classes have corresponding
      <tt>Static</tt>... variants. If they are initialised while
      the engine is not running, they defer the actual (Prolog-side)
      initialisation until the engine is ready. If it is restarted, they
      reinitialise. Apart from that, they behave mostly like
      their non-static counterparts. The above can be achieved like this.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">StaticTerm t(&quot;foo(1,2,3)&quot;);

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  // ...
}
</pre>

<a name="id2704740"></a>Working With Terms</h2></div></div>
<p>A <tt>Term</tt> object is essentially a pointer into the global term
      component graph. However, there is a difference: they can't be
      compared. (There is no way to define comparision operators on the
      terms-as-pointers). This means, for instance, that terms can't be
      used as keys for sorted containers. The comparision operators which
      are defined for <tt>Term</tt> compare the terms pointed to, not the
      pointers.
    </p>
<p>Terms can be created from many data types, and they can be
      converted to those data types. This is very convenient, since terms
      can be used much like if they were the values they contain.
      Similarly, global comparision operators are defined. For instance:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">Term myfunction(int i, Term t)
{
  if (i &gt; t) {
    int ints[] = { 1, 2, 3 };
    return list&lt;int&gt;(ints, ints+3);
  }
  // ...
}
</pre>
<p>
<tt>Term</tt> objects refer data managed by the Prolog engine.
      When new <tt>Term</tt> obejcts are created, new storage space is allocated
      inside the engine. It will eventually be garbage collected, if it
      is no longer referenced. But simply destroying the <tt>Term</tt> objects
      will <i>not</i> remove the references. (Because of the
      way the SWI-Prolog engine works, this isn't possible). In order to
      ensure that unused data will be deleted, frames must be used. See
      <a href="#frfrm" title="Frames and Frame Membership">the section called &#x201C;Frames and Frame Membership&#x201D;</a>.
    </p>
<p>C++ code called from the Prolog side (a foreign predicate) runs
      in an implicit frame, so ressources it allocated will eventually be
      reclaimed. But if the Prolog engine is embedded in C++ code (terms
      being manipulated outside any foreign predicate invocations) frames
      must be used explicitly. They should also be used in long
      computations inside foreign predicates.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="frfrm"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="frfrm"></a>Frames and Frame Membership</h2></div></div>
<p>
      Frames and frame membership do not need to be considered if terms are
      only manipulated inside foreign predicates, and no <tt>Term</tt> objects are
      kept between invocations of foreign predicates (such as storing them
      as global variables or on the heap). Otherwise, things become a bit
      more complicated.
    </p>
<p>Creating a new <tt>Term</tt> object consumes ressources in the Prolog
      engine in two ways. First, a cell on the so called &#x201C;local
      stack&#x201D;, is allocated. Stack cells are references to data
      (terms) held by the Prolog engine. Second, as long as such data is
      referenced, it will not be garbage collected. Assigning a new value
      to the <tt>Term</tt> object will not destroy the old reference.
    </p>
<p>
      In order to reclaim the stack cells, code portions are enclosed
      in frames. When the frame is left, all stack cells which have been
      allocated inside of it will be freed. Closing a frame has no other
      effect. After the local stack cells are no longer in use, the
      data they refered can be garbage collected.
      Frames nest. There is an implicit outermost frame, which encloses the
      entire execution of the Prolog engine (from initialisation until
      shutdown).
    </p>
<p>Every foreign predicate runs in an implicit frame. This is
      only the case if it is called by the Prolog engine, as a foreign
      predicate. Calling the same function from the C++ side, as an
      ordinary C++ function, does not make it run in a frame. Foreign
      predicates are discussed in <a href="#fopre" title="Foreign Predicates">the section called &#x201C;Foreign Predicates&#x201D;</a>.
    </p>
<p>
      Every valid <tt>Term</tt> object is member of one of the currently active
      frames, because it uses a stack cell. Closing a frame
      <i>invalidates any still existing <tt>Term</tt> objects which belong
      to that frame</i>. Invalid <tt>Term</tt>s are allowed to exist, but
      they must not be used, except for assigning a new value.
    </p>
<p>
      When a new <tt>Term</tt> object is created, it becomes member of the
      currently active (innermost) frame. <tt>Frame</tt>s are supposed to be used
      as automatic variables. When a <tt>Frame</tt> object is destroyed (when the
      variable goes out of scope), the corresponding frame is closed.
      <tt>Term</tt>s should be automatic variables as well, and be passed by
      value. When used this way, invalid <tt>Term</tt>s are unlikely to occur. For
      instance:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">Term t1;
{
  Frame fr;
  Term t2 = &quot;foo(X,Y)&quot;;
  func(t2);
  t1.unify(t2);
  // ...

} // t2 invalidated and out of scope, t1 unaffected
</pre>
<p>The following, on the other hand, will probably cause a crash.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">Term* termptr;
{
  Frame fr;
  termptr = new Term;
  termptr-&gt;unify(&quot;foo(X,Y)&quot;);
}
cout &lt;&lt; *termptr;
</pre>
<p>When a <tt>Term</tt> object is assigned a new value - being made point to
      another term - it <i>changes frame membership</i>. It
      &#x201C;migrates&#x201D; to the same frame as the other <tt>Term</tt>. (This
      unfortunate behaviour can't be avoided; see the <a href="#termsemantics" title="Semantics of Term Objects">implementation notes</a> for details
      why).
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">Term t;
{
  Frame fr;
  t = 42;
} // t invalidated

cout &lt;&lt; t; // crash
</pre>
<p>In the above example, <tt>t = 42</tt> is the same as
      <tt>t = Term(42)</tt>, and the new term &#x201C;42&#x201D;
      becomes member of the frame <tt>fr</tt>.
      <tt>t</tt> is then assigned this new term, and also becomes
      member of <tt>fr</tt>. It is invalidated when
      <tt>fr</tt> is left.
    </p>
<p>In order to avoid this, the following code should be used instead.
      <tt>t</tt> starts by pointing to a free variable, which can
      then be bound.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">Term t;
{
  Frame fr;
  t.unify(42);
}

cout &lt;&lt; t;
</pre>
<p>In the above example, the <tt>Term</tt> object isn't actually changed -
      the term pointed to is changed. 
    </p>
<p>Yet to discuss is a more exotic way to assign to a <tt>Term</tt>,
      which should be avoided if at all possibe. It's the
      <tt>Term::assign()</tt> method. Sometimes it might be
      necessary to actually change the pointer, making it point to a
      different term. <tt>assign()</tt> does this. It does
      the same as an assignment, but <i>without</i> making
      the <tt>Term</tt> object migrate to a different frame. The example can also
      correctly be implemented like this. Again, a term is created from the
      integer 42 by an implicit conversion.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">Term t;
{
  Frame fr;
  t.assign(42);
}

cout &lt;&lt; t;
</pre>
<p>The drawback is that <tt>assign()</tt> can not be used
      if copies of the <tt>Term</tt> object exist. You must guarantee this, or you
      will break the class <tt>Term</tt>'s semantics of behaving like pointers to
      terms. For instance:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">Term t1 = 42;
Term t2 = t1;

// t1 == t2 == 42

t1.assign(&quot;foobar&quot;);

// Now *both*, t1 and t2 point to &quot;foobar&quot;.
</pre>
<p>(The difference between <tt>Term::operator = ()</tt> and
      <tt>Term::assign()</tt> is that the assignment operator
      makes the object use the same stack cell as the other term, whereas
      <tt>assign()</tt> changes the contents of the stack cell in
      use.)
    </p>
<p>When possible, unification should be used instead of
      <tt>assign()</tt>. Another option might be <a href="#recordedterm" title="RecordedTerm"><tt>RecordedTerm</tt></a>.
    </p>
<p>So far, the use of frames for freeing unused memory space inside
      the Prolog engine has been discussed. There is another purpose for
      frames: causing backtracking.
    </p>
<p>
      Backtracking is caused by calling the frame's
      <tt>rewind()</tt> method. This will backtrack to the point
      where the frame was opened, undoing all unifications (bindings). The
      references to data created inside the Prolog engine are also
      destroyed. This means that all <tt>Term</tt> objects which belong to the
      frame are invalidated. Calling <tt>rewind()</tt> does not
      close the frame. It just goes back to the state when the frame has
      been opened.

<p>In order to precisely capture some of the semantics of the
      classes provided by SwiProlog-C++, this documentation uses the notions of
      <i>concepts</i> and <i>models</i>, as
      defined in <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/" target="_top">SGI's
      documentation of the Standard Template Library</a>.
    </p>
<p>In short, a concept specifies a set of syntactic expressions
      which must be valid for a type, and their meaning. A model of the
      concept is a type which satisfies all the requirements. The generic
      (template based) classes and functions of the STL can be used for
      types which are models of the specified concepts. See the <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/stl_introduction.html" target="_top">introduction
      page of the SGI documentation</a> for details.
    </p>
<p>The following concepts are used in SwiProlog-C++. The semantics are
      that some operations are defined the way you would expect.</p>
<div class="section">
<a name="concepta"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="concepta"></a>Assignable</h3></div></div>
<p>A type is Assignable if it is possible to copy objects of
        that type and to assign values of the type to variables. The
        copy constructor, assignment operator and
        <tt>swap</tt> method must be defined.</p>

<div class="section">
<a name="conceptdc"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="conceptdc"></a>Default Constructible</h3></div></div>
<p>A type is Default Constructible if it has a default
        constructor.</p>

<div class="section">
<a name="conceptec"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="conceptec"></a>Equality Comparable</h3></div></div>
<p>A type is Equality Comparable if objects of that type can be
        compared for equality using <tt>operator == ()</tt>, and
        if it is an equivalence relation. <tt>operator
        == ()</tt> and <tt>operator != ()</tt> must be
        defined.

<a name="conceptltc"></a>Less Than Comparable</h3></div></div>
<p>A type is Less Than Comparable if it has the comparision
        operators <tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;</tt>,
        <tt>&gt;=</tt> and <tt>&lt;=</tt> defined,
        and they implement a partial ordering.

<pre class="programlisting">void prolog_init(int argc, char const * const * argv);
void prolog_halt(void);
</pre>
<p>
<tt>prolog_init</tt> initialises the Prolog engine.
        It must be called before anything which involves it can be
        performed. The parameters <i><tt>argc</tt></i> and
        <i><tt>argv</tt></i> are the ones from the
        <tt>main</tt> function. It calls the Foreign Language Interface function
        <tt>PL_initialise</tt>. This can fail for many reasons,
        in which case a <tt>GeneralError</tt> is thrown. See the SWI-Prolog
        Reference Manual for the exact actions which are taken.
      </p>
<p>
<tt>prolog_halt</tt> shuts down the prolog engine.
        This is done automatically when the program exits, so you normally
        do not need to call this function.
      </p>
<p>You can shut down the prolog engine with
      <tt>prolog_halt</tt> and restart it with
      <tt>prolog_init</tt>. Note that this is very expensive.
      All data which lives inside the Prolog engine is destroyed in this
      process, all <tt>Term</tt> objects invalidated, etc.

</pre>
<p>These operators let you compare a term to a value of any type
          which it can be converted to. First they convert the <tt>Term</tt>
          parameter to the template type <tt>V</tt>. Then they
          apply the corresponding comparision operator. This way, a <tt>Term</tt>
          can be compared with a value of any type which it can be converted
          to, and which has the comparision operator defined. If the
          conversion fails, an exception is raised (at least for the
          conversions defined by SwiProlog-C++).
        </p>
<p>For instance, assume <tt>t</tt> is of type <tt>Term</tt>.
          Then <tt>t &gt; 42</tt> means <tt>((int) t) &gt;
          42</tt>. This is different from <tt>t &gt; (Term)
          42</tt>, which compares <tt>t</tt> to
          <tt>42</tt> in standard term order. When both arguments
          are terms, you they are always compared in standard term order. If
          you want to compare them as values of some type, you need to
          convert one of them. For instance, <tt>t1 &gt; (int)
          t2</tt>.

<p>The class <tt>Atom</tt> represents Prolog atoms. It is a model of
        <a href="#conceptec" title="Equality Comparable">Equality Comparable</a>, <a href="#conceptltc" title="Less Than Comparable">Less Than Comparable</a> and <a href="#concepta" title="Assignable">Assignable</a>. <tt>Atom</tt> objects don't have
        any meaningful order, such as lexicographic. It is only guaranteed
        that the comparision operators implement a total ordering. This is
        enough to store atoms in sorted containers such as
        <tt>set&lt;&gt;</tt> or <tt>map&lt;&gt;</tt>.
        (In fact, the handles which the Prolog engine assigns are
        compared).
      </p>
<pre class="programlisting">Atom::Atom(const char *);
Atom::Atom(string);
</pre>
<p>This creates an <tt>Atom</tt> which represents an already existing
          or newly created Prolog atom. The string is copied to memory
          managed by the Prolog engine.
        </p>
<pre class="programlisting">Atom::Atom(const Term&amp;);
Atom::Atom(string);
</pre>
<p>This extracts an atom from a term which only consists of
          that atom. If the term does not encapsulate one atom, then an
          <tt>ConversionError</tt> exception is raised.
        </p>
<pre class="programlisting">bool Atom::operator == (const Atom&amp;) const;
bool Atom::operator != (const Atom&amp;) const;

bool Atom::operator &gt;  (const Atom&amp;) const;

        </p>
<pre class="programlisting">Atom::operator const char * () const;
</pre>
<p>This returns the atom as a string. The string resides in
          static memory managed by the Prolog engine, and remains valid as
          long as it is not garbage collected. This means, as long as any
          term exists which uses the atom. It must not be changed.
        </p>
<p>The conversion requires one function call. This is relatively
          expensive.
        </p>
<pre class="programlisting">ostream&amp; operator &lt;&lt; (ostream&amp;, const Atom&amp;);

<a name="id2700036"></a><tt>Frame</tt></h3></div></div>
<p>There are two purposes of frames: reclaiming ressources and
        retrying. Creating new <tt>Term</tt> objects will consume local stack
        cells in the Prolog engine. Enclosing a code portion in a frame
        will reclaim the stack cells when the frame is left, thereby
        invalidating any <tt>Term</tt> objects which might still be using them.
        Closing a frame has no other effect.
      </p>
<p>Rewinding a frame is a different thing. It has the effect of
        backtracking to the point where the frame was opened. All bindings
        (unifications) done since the frame was opened are undone, and all
        data created inside the Prolog engine is no longer referenced and
        therefore deleted. The local stack cells are also reclaimed.
      </p>
<p>Note that every foreign predicate invocation done by the Prolog
        engine runs inside an implicit frame.
      </p>
<pre class="programlisting">Frame::Frame();
</pre>
<p>This opens a new frame. It will be closed when the object is
        destroyed. Normally, a <tt>Frame</tt> is an automatic variable, so the
        frame will be closed when the variable goes out of scope.
      </p>
<pre class="programlisting">Frame::~Frame();
</pre>
<p>Destroying the <tt>Frame</tt> object closes the frame. All <tt>Term</tt>
        objects which belong to the frame are invalidated, and the
        associated ressources (cells on the local stack) reclaimed. Any
        unifications done with the terms pointed to stay in effect.
      </p>
<pre class="programlisting">void Frame::rewind();
</pre>
<p>Invalidate all <tt>Term</tt>s which belong to the frame, and undo all
        unifications done since the frame was created. The frame stays
        open. This calls the Foreign Language Interface function
        <tt>PL_rewind_foreign_frame()</tt>.
      </p>
<p>(There is no need for an equivalent of
        <tt>PL_discard_foreign_frame</tt>, because the effect is
        achieved by calling <tt>Frame::rewind()</tt> before the <tt>Frame</tt>
        object is destroyed).

<p>A <tt>Query</tt> is a simple and direct wrapper of the Foreign Language Interface query

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul>
<li><p>
<a name="id2762712"></a>The query can by secified as the predicate to be called

            like you can in Prolog. Any composite subterms of the predicate
            must be supplied as argument terms, which you must build and
            decompose on your own. <tt>StaticQuery</tt> provides a more

<li><p>
<a name="id2762745"></a>The Prolog engine must be running before a <tt>Query</tt> object can

<li><p>

<pre class="programlisting">Query::Query(const char * name, int arity, Module context_module = Module());
Query::Query(Predicate predicate, Module context_module = Module());
</pre>
<p>These two constructors create a new query from the predicate to
        be called and the context module. To the first one, you specify the
        predicate as name and arity, to the second one as a <tt>Predicate</tt>
        object. The context module is relevant only for context transparent
        queries (see the SWI-Prolog Reference Manual). The singleton context module, which is the

<p>These operators supply the arguments and start the query. You

        unifying unbound variables within the argument terms. The first

        is called for the first time. The operators test if the number of
        arguments matches the required number, and if another query is
        still running. In either case, a <tt>LogicError</tt> is thrown.
      </p>
<pre class="programlisting">bool Query::next();
</pre>
<p>Generate the first or next result. The unifications done in the

        query is automatically closed and <tt>false</tt> is
        returned. Prolog exceptions, raised inside the Prolog engine, are
        converted to C++ and thrown as <tt>PrologException</tt>s. A <tt>LogicError</tt> is

        to throw <tt>UnsafePrologException</tt>s instead of <tt>PrologException</tt>s.
        You normally don't need this flag.
      </p>
<p>A Prolog exception is a term. Throwing terms as parts of
        exceptions is a bad idea, because many things can happen to them
        when the stack is unwound. Most notably, when leaving a frame, they
        are invalidated. Also, shared subterms could be changed by
        unification or deunification. Therefore, <tt>PrologException</tt> stores
        the term in its external representation, as returned by
        <tt>Term::to_external()</tt>. This makes it completely
        unvolunerable to any hazards. The method
        <tt>as_term()</tt> converts the term back, so what it
        returns is actually a deep copy of the original term.
      </p>
<p>The safety comes at a small price. First, there is a
        performance penalty for creating the external representation.
        Normally exceptions are exceptional, and exception terms are
        small, so there is no problem. Second, it
        <i>might</i> be possible, in some pathological
        design, that indirectly changing the exception term via unification
        or deunification of shared subterms is intended. This normally
        isn't the case. Under almost all circumstances, the default
        behaviour is fine.
      </p>
<p>The <tt>unsafe_exceptions</tt> flag gives you full
        control. <a href="#unsafeprologexception"><tt>UnsafePrologException</tt></a>
        differs from <tt>PrologException</tt> in that it does not store the
        exception term in external form, but includes it as a <tt>Term</tt>
        attribute, which is returned by <tt>as_term()</tt>. This
        is dangerous.

<p>This is a subclass of <tt>Query</tt>, and improves it in the following ways.
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul>
<li><p>
<a name="id2763552"></a><tt>StaticQuery</tt> objects can be created before the Prolog
            engine is running. The actual initialisation is defered. They
            reinitialise themselves when the engine is restarted. This
            makes <tt>StaticQuery</tt> suitable for objects which reside in static
            memory, such as global variables.
          </p></li>
<li><p>
<a name="id2763573"></a>An easy way for specifying queries which have subterms is
            provided, which makes it exactly like in Prolog.
          </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>A <tt>StaticQuery</tt> can be specified in one of two ways.
        &#x2018;Predicate mode&#x2019; is the way <tt>Query</tt> works. You specify
        a predicate, and its arguments are the query arguments.
      </p>
<p>In &#x2018;Prolog mode&#x2019; the query still has a
        predicate to be called, but its arguments may themselves be terms,
        with the actual query arguments being free variables inside of
        them. In this mode, the arguments provided when a new query is
        started, are filled in there. Only non-anonymous variables (names
        not starting with &#x2018;&lt;literal&gt;_&lt;/literal&gt;&#x2019;)
        become query arguments. For instance, the term
        <tt>mypred(foo(bar(X,_,Y)),Z)</tt> specifies a query
        which has three arguments.
      </p>
<p>Predicate mode is more efficient than Prolog mode, both time
        and space wise. The <tt>StaticQuery</tt> can't know if the predicate
        arguments it constructed last time, are still valid when a new
        query is started. Therefore, it stores them in a <tt>RecordedTerm</tt>,
        and creates a new copy every time. This means, a handfull of
        possible extra function calls to the Foreign Language Interface, and a few extra terms
        created, which will later be garbage collected.
      </p>
<pre class="programlisting">StaticQuery::StaticQuery(const char* name, int arity, const char* mod = 0);
StaticQuery::StaticQuery(const char* text, const char* mod = 0);
</pre>
<p>The first one creates the new <tt>StaticQuery</tt> in predicate
        mode, like <tt>Query</tt>. <tt>name</tt> and
        <tt>arity</tt> are name and arity of the predicate to be
        called.
        The second one creates it in Prolog mode. <tt>text</tt>
        specifies the query as a term.
      </p>
<p>
        <tt>mod</tt> is the name of the context module (which is
        relevant only for module transparent predicates). &#x2018;When NULL, the
        context module of the calling context will be used, or user if
        there is no calling context (as may happen in embedded systems).&#x2019;
      </p>
<p>
<tt>name</tt>, <tt>text</tt> and
        <tt>mod</tt> must stay valid, so they can be used when
        the Prolog engine is stared or restarted. They are supposed to be
        string literals. No memory management is done of them by
        <tt>StaticQuery</tt>.

<p>This means that you can't use <tt>Term</tt> as a parameter for a template

        instance, <tt>Term</tt>s can't be used as key for sorted containers. [ If
        <tt>Term</tt>s are used in such a way that they have the semantics of
        terms (not term pointers), then this might still be possible. But
        you would need to either restrict yourself to ground terms or
        interpret variables as standing for themselves. Be sure you know
        what you're doing. ]

<p>Every <tt>Term</tt> belongs to a frame. Unless initialized in an
        assignment (by the copy constructor), it always starts in the
        current frame. If a <tt>Term</tt> is assigned another one, then it
        &#x2018;migrates&#x2019; to the frame of that term, unless

<p>Assume the term is a Prolog list. Write its contents to the

        <tt>TargetType</tt>. The template parameter
        <tt>OutputIterator</tt> can be infered, but

        called with one template parameter, like

      </p>
<p>(The target type can't be infered from the iterator
        type, because STL output iterators don't have value types. The same
        output iterator can be able to absorb values of several differnt types.)
      </p>
<p>The following paragraphs are relevant only if you want to
        use <tt>copy_list</tt> to convert the element
        terms to C strings (<tt>char*</tt> or <tt>const
        char*</tt>).
      </p>
<p>
<tt>copy_list&lt;&gt;</tt> has a different meaning
        for the target type <tt>char*</tt> than for other types -
        it doesn't write the values to the output iterator, but pointers to
        them. The values themselves are on the heap, and must be deleted
        later.
      </p>
<p>The default conversion of terms to <tt>char*</tt> isn't
        applicable, because it wouldn't copy the strings to the C++ heap,
        but leave them in a SWI-Prolog managed ring buffer, which is 16
        entries large. Therefore <tt>copy_list&lt;&gt;</tt> is
        specialised for the target type <tt>char*</tt>, such that
        the strings are copied to the heap. The follwoing is an example of
        how to use <tt>copy_list&lt;&gt;</tt>.

<p>
<tt>copy_term&lt;&gt;</tt> is
        <i>not</i> specialised for <tt>const

        returning a <tt>const</tt> pointer, which can't be used
        to delete it, would result in a memory leak. The default conversion
        returns pointers which point to memory managed by the SWI-Prolog
        ring buffer, which is 16 entries large. So only lists up to 16
        elements can be converted by <tt>copy_list&lt;const

<p>Convert the term to a string, using

        with the default options. The returned pointer points to memory

        atom, then this is static memory which remains valid (at least as
        long as the atom exists). Otherwise it is in a ring buffer, which
        will eventually be deallocated. The string must be copied if it is
        to be used other than short-term. (See
        <tt>PL_get_chars()</tt> in the SWI-Prolog Reference Manual - &#x2018;if the data

      </p>
<p>There is no <tt>Term::operator string</tt>, because
        C++ strings can be created via <tt>operator const char*

<p>This template is specialized for <tt>char*</tt>,

        for eventually deleting them. Consider using
        <tt>list&lt;string&gt;</tt> instead.
      </p>
<p>Using <tt>operator list&lt;const char*&gt;</tt> is
        probably an error. The strings can't be copied to the heap, because
        they could not be be deleted via the <tt>const char*</tt>

<p>This chapter discusses various implementation aspects of
        SwiProlog-C++. It is meant for people who want to maintain or improve
        it, or just want to understand the source code. Normal users of the
        interface do not need these notes.

<a name="id2765709"></a>All new term references are created on the local stack. When
            a foreign predicate returns, or a frame is left, these references
            are invalidated. So all terms created have a limited life time.
            In order to use them as global data on the C++ side, they must be
            saved somehow.

<a name="termsemantics"></a>Semantics of <tt>Term</tt> Objects</h2></div></div>
<p>The only way to refer to terms are by term_t values, as
        provided by the Foreign Language Interface. A term_t is an index on the local stack.
        The stack cells are like pointers to terms. So a term_t has the
        semantics of a pointer to pointers to terms (not of a pointer to
        terms). This means that, as well as the terms pointed to, the local
        stack cells can change. For instance:
      </p>
<pre class="programlisting">// create two term_t's pointing to the term &quot;42&quot;
term_t t1 = PL_new_term_ref();
term_t t2 = t1;
PL_put_integer(t1, 42);

// change one
PL_put_atom_chars(t1, &quot;hello&quot;);

// now both term_t's point to &quot;hello&quot;
</pre>
<p>The most direct way would be to encapsulate a term_t in a class
        <tt>Term</tt> and to define appropriate operators and methods for it. This
        would give <tt>Term</tt>s the semantics of being pointers to pointers
        to terms, too. The programmer would have to manually create stack
        cells and deal with pointers to them, just like in the C language Foreign Language Interface
      </p>
<p>This makes working with terms unnecessarily tedious, error prone
        and complex. It is possible to transparently handle the enclosed
        term_ts in such a way that <tt>Term</tt> objects have the semantics of
        pointers to terms instead, which allows for a much more intuitive,
        direct programming style. There are two ways to accomplish this.
      </p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"></ol></div>
<p>The first approach has the advantage that it is efficient. A
        <tt>Term</tt> object structurally consists only of a term_t attribute,
        which is copied and passed around just like in the C interface (all
        the methods are inline).
      </p>
<p>However, it badly interacts with frames. Leaving a frame
        invalidates stack cells. Since the stack cell a <tt>Term</tt> uses, changes
        with each assignment to it, it is hard to predict which <tt>Term</tt>s wiil
        be invalidated.
      </p>
<pre class="programlisting">Term t1;
{
  Frame f;
  Term t2(42);
  t1 = t2;
}
// now t1 _and_ t2 are invalid
</pre>
<p>Even worse, it's impossible to save references to terms created
        inside a frame, like you can when using the C interface.
      </p>
<pre class="programlisting">term_t t1 = PL_new_term_ref();

  fid_t f = PL_open_foreign_frame();
  term_t t2 = PL_new_term_ref();
  // ... create data and make t2 point to it ...

  // save reference in t1 before t2 is lost, and close frame
  PL_put_term(t1, t2);
  PL_close_foreign_frame(f);

// now t2 is invalid, but t1 points to the data
</pre>
<p>These frame related problems don't occur with the second
        approach. But it would make using <tt>Term</tt> objects quite inefficient.
        Every time you pass a <tt>Term</tt> by value, PL_copy_term_ref() is called,
        and a stack cell is consumed. This would in effect force you to use
        references or pointers to <tt>Term</tt>s instead, making you unable to use
        <tt>Term</tt>s the way they are supposed to, like pointers.
      </p>
<p>It is legal to write to a stack cell, provided the <tt>Term</tt> holding
        it is the only one to do so. The changing of the cell will not affect
        any other <tt>Term</tt>s as well.
      </p>

<a name="initqueue"></a>Init Queues</h2></div></div>
<p>The &#x201C;static&#x201D; classes automatically (re)initialise
        themselves. In order to be notfied when this is necessary, they
        derive protectely from the class <tt>Init</tt>, which
        makes them members of an init queue.
      </p>
<p>Init queue members have two methods, <tt>thaw()</tt>
        and <tt>freeze()</tt>. They get thawed when they need to
        be initialised, and frozen when they need to save some state. There
        are two init queues. All members are thawed/frozen on certain
        occasions.
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul>
<li><p>
<a name="id2766057"></a>The <i>engine queue</i> is thawed when the
            Prolog engine has been initialised. This causes the
            <tt>Static...</tt> class objects to initialise
            themselves as well. It is frozen, before it goes down.
          </p></li>
<li><p>
<a name="id2766080"></a>One <i>frame queue</i> per frame. It gets
            frozen when the frame goes out of scope. It doesn't cause any
            thawing. The objects need to check for themselves. This queue
            is only used by <tt>StaticQuery</tt>.
          </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>When an object is enqueued in the engine queue, and the engine
        is already running, it is thawed immediately by calling the
        <tt>thaw()</tt> method. The object initialises itself in
        frozen state. Then it enqueues itself and maybe get thawed
        immediately.
      </p>
<p>This means that the class <tt>Init</tt> part of the
        object need to be created last. Its initialisation doesn't take
        part in its constructor, but is defered, and explicitly called from
        inside the larger object's constructor.
      </p>
<p>The class <tt>Init</tt> looks like this.
      </p>
<pre class="programlisting">struct Init
{
  Init*  next;    // next queue element
  Init** prev;    // pointer to pointer pointing to this element

  Init(Defer);    // no initialisation (enqueueing) yet

  // initialisation takes place here
  void enqueue(Init** queue);

  ~Init();        // dequeue oneself

  virtual void thaw() = 0;
  virtual void freeze() = 0;

  void thaw_all();     // thaw entire queue starting here
  void freeze_all();   // freeze entire queue starting here

<a name="fopre"></a>Foreign Predicates</h2></div></div>
<p>SWI-Prolog has two methods of calling foreign functions, and two
        corresponding kinds of signatures. Both of them use the C interface
        types, such as <tt>foreign_t foo(term_t, term_t)</tt>. We
        want to interface to functions like <tt>bool foo(Term,
          Term)</tt>, and translate Prolog exceptions to C++ exceptions
        and vice versa. So wee need wrapper functions which comply to the C
        signatures, do the conversions and translations, and call the C++
        functions. It does not seem to be possible to determine the
        name/arity of the predicate being called inside some generic
        function, so we need one real wrapper function per foreign predicate.
      </p>
<p>Such wrapper functions could be automatically generated with the
        help of templates. The templates would look like this.
      </p>
<pre class="programlisting">template &lt;bool (*Fkt)()&gt;
foreign_t fp_helper()
{
  try {
    return (Fkt() ? TRUE : FALSE);
  } catch (const char* ex) {
    return PL_raise_exception(Term(Atom(ex)).lsi);
  }
}

template &lt;bool (*Fkt)(Term)&gt;
foreign_t fp_helper(term_t t1)
{
  try {
    return (Fkt(Term(t1)) ? TRUE : FALSE);
  } catch (const char* ex) {
    return PL_raise_exception(Term(Atom(ex)).lsi);
  }
}

template &lt;bool (*Fkt)(Term, Term)&gt;
foreign_t fp_helper(term_t t1, term_t t2)
{
  try {
    return (Fkt(Term(t1, t2)) ? TRUE : FALSE);
  } catch (const char* ex) {
    return PL_raise_exception(Term(Atom(ex)).lsi);
  }
}

// and so on
</pre>
<p>Alas, GCC bugs prevent this. It seems like it's impossible to
        take the address of a template function. For now, we use macros
        instead. We also need to use the other calling convention, which
        leads to the current implementation.

<a name="implframes"></a>Frames</h2></div></div>
<p>Only terms (<tt>Term</tt> and its variants <tt>RecordedTerm</tt> and
        <tt>StaticTerm</tt>) are affected by frames. All the other things (atoms,
        functors, foreign predicates and so on) live as long as the engine.
      </p>
<p>A frame going out of scope has two effects. First, all bindings
        done inside it are undone. This can potentially affect all terms, but
        they stay valid. Second, all local stack indices created inside the
        frame, ald all <tt>Term</tt>s using them are invalidated. There is an
        implicit frame, in which every foreign predicate invocation runs.
        Explicit frames can be created with the <tt>Frame</tt> class as well.
      </p>
<p>There is no way to rescue term references from being invalidated
        once a frame is entered. You can only create free variables before the
      </p>
<p>Leaving a frame invalidates the <tt>Term</tt> parts of <tt>RecordedTerm</tt>s
        and <tt>StaticTerm</tt>s. There are no special measures to take for <tt>Term</tt>s.
        They just become invalid and must not be used any longer. The other
        two, however, are supposed to survive.
      </p>
<p>An automatic wakeup feature for <tt>RecordedTerm</tt> shoed not to be
        feasible, because you can't keep track of which frame the <tt>Term</tt>
        part of a <tt>RecordedTerm</tt> belongs to. The <tt>RecordedTerm</tt> can't know
        when its <tt>Term</tt> part becomes invalid.

<a name="id2766350"></a>Queries</h2></div></div>
<p>The following components are require by the Foreign Language Interface in order to
        execute a query.
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul>
<li><p>
<a name="id2766367"></a> a context module identifier </p></li>
<li><p>
<a name="id2766376"></a> an array of term references for the arguments </p></li>
<li><p>
<a name="id2766385"></a> a predicate identifier </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>A <tt>Query</tt> packages just that. The term references array is
        reused. It does not do any re-initialising like the
        <tt>Static</tt>... classes. When the frame in which the
        query was created is left, the term references, and so the query is
        invalidated.
      </p>
<p>A <tt>StaticQuery</tt> additionally has the follwoing components.
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul>
<li><p>
<a name="id2766427"></a> A <tt>RecordedTerm</tt> attribute <tt>callterm</tt>.
            This stores predefined subterms of the query predicate
            (arguments for an ordinary <tt>Query</tt>), and has the actual
            arguments as crosswise bound variables, like
            <tt>args(arg1(foo(X),_),bar(Y), X,Y)</tt>.
          </p></li>
<li><p>
<a name="id2766462"></a>
          </p></li>
<li><p>
<a name="id2766470"></a>
          </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>A <tt>StaticQuery</tt> reinitialises itself in two differerent ways,
        and needs to be member of both init queues. Because it can be a
        subclass of <tt>Init</tt> only once, the engine queue
        membership is implemented by an attribute.
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul>
<li><p>
<a name="id2766502"></a>When the frame is closed, the array of term
            references for the query arguments is invalidated. The
            <tt>freeze()</tt> is used to reset the
            <tt>predargs</tt> attribute, so it can later be
            reinitialised.
          </p></li>
<li><p>
<a name="id2766528"></a>When the engine is initialised, the <tt>StaticQuery</tt> object
